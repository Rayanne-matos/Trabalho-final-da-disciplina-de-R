No per{\'{i}}odo de estudo, a quantidade total de serapilheira produzida foi de 5646,9 kg.ha-1.ano-1, onde a fra{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o 'folhas' teve a maior participa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, contribuindo com 4081,2 kg.ha¹.ano-1, seguida pela fra{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o 'ramos' (1066,1 kg.ha-1.ano-1), 'estruturas reprodutivas' (434,1 kg.ha-1.ano-1) e 'miscel{\^{a}}nea' (65,5 kg.ha-1.ano-1). A produ{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de serapilheira foi altamente estacional e correlacionou-se negativamente com a umidade relativa do ar e com a temperatura m{\'{e}}dia do ar. A produ{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o foliar correlacionou-se negativamente com a umidade do ar, precipita{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e temperatura m{\'{e}}dia do ar. N{\~{a}}o houve diferen{\c{c}}a significativa entre a produ{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de serapilheira desse estudo e a encontrada em duas outras {\'{a}}reas com cerrad{\~{a}}o e mata mes{\'{o}}fila semidec{\'{i}}dua, por{\'{e}}m essas fisionomias vegetais diferiram significativamente da produ{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o em outra {\'{a}}rea com cerrado sensu stricto. A taxa de decomposi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o (K) obtida para o material foliar foi de 0,56, com o tempo para decomposi{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de 50{\%} do material estimado em 1,8 anos e o tempo de renova{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do material foliar em 2,3 anos.We estimate litter production and leaf decomposition rate in a cerrad{\~{a}}o area, physiognomy little studied and very threatened in S{\~{a}}o Paulo State. During the period of study, litter production was 5646.9 kg.ha-1.year-1, which the 'leaf' fraction corresponded to 4081.2 kg.ha¹.year¹; the 'branch' fraction, to 1066.1 kg.ha-1.year-1; the 'reproductive structures' fraction, to 434.1 kg.ha-1.year-1; and the 'miscellaneous' fraction to 65.5 kg.ha-1.year-1. Litter production was highly seasonal and negatively correlated with relative humidity and air temperature. Leaf production was negatively correlated with relative humidity, rainfall, and air temperature. There was no significant difference between litter production found in this study and those in two other sites with cerrad{\~{a}}o and semideciduous forest, but these physiognomies differed significantly from the cerrado sensu stricto. Leaf decomposition rate (K) was 0.56. Half-life of the decomposing material was 1.8 years and turnover time was 2.3 years.},

abstract = {Litterfall plays an important role in nutrient cycling and maintenance of soil fertility in terrestrial ecosystems. Annual and seasonal variation in litterfall have been investigated in various habitats, however, seasonality in nutrient supply is less well documented. We studied litterfall over two years and seasonal litter nutrient input over one year across a tropical disturbance gradient from mature forest to monoculture tea plantation. Total litter production in the mature forests and regenerating forests was not significantly different. However, tea plantations had significantly lower litter production. Total litterfall in forest habitats showed a clear seasonal pattern with a peak during the dry season (Mar.-May), as has been reported for other tropical seasonal forests. Contrary to expectations, there was no significant difference in litter nutrient concentrations across the disturbance gradient, although there was a substantial change in plant species composition. Litter nutrient concentrations also did not vary significantly across seasons, again contrary to our expectations. Thus, nutrient input was driven solely by the seasonal litterfall pattern. Our results suggest that at a landscape scale turnover in species composition linked to anthropogenic disturbance may not always lead to changes in litter quality, presumably because a similar spectra of leaf types may exist across communities. Seasonal litterfall patterns, which have been more commonly studied, may prove a reasonable proxy for nutrient input in forests.},

abstract = {Tropical rainforests play an important role in the storage and cycling of global terrestrial carbon. In the carbon cycle, net primary productivity of forests is linked to soil respiration through the production and decomposition of forest litter. Climate seasonality appears to influence the production of litter although there is considerable variability within and across forests that makes accurate estimates challenging. We explored the effects of climate seasonality on litterfall dynamics in a lowland humid rainforest over a 7-year period from 2007 to 2013, including an El Ni{\~{n}}o/La Ni{\~{n}}a cycle in 2010/2011. Litterfall was sampled fortnightly in 24 traps of 0.50 m diameter within a 1-ha forest plot. Total mean litterfall was 10.48 ± 1.32 (±SD, dry weight) Mg ha−1 year−1 and seasonal in distribution. The different components of litterfall were divided into LLeaf (63.5{\%}), LWood (27.7{\%}) and LFF[flowers {\&} fruit] (8.8{\%}), which all demonstrated seasonal dynamics. Peak falls in LLeaf and LWood were highly predictable, coinciding with maximum daily temperatures and 1 and 2 months prior to maximum monthly rainfall. The El Ni{\~{n}}o/La Ni{\~{n}}a cycle coincided with elevated local winter temperatures and peak falls of LLeaf and LWood. Importantly, we establish how sampling length and generalized additive models eliminate the requirement for extensive within-site sampling when the intention is to describe dynamics in litterfall patterns. Further, a greater understanding of seasonal cycles in litterfall allows us to distinguish between endogenous controls and environmental factors, such as El Ni{\~{n}}o events, which may have significant impacts on biochemical cycles.},
